# ITG
ITG validation form


Implementing some of the optional points:

Google reCAPTCHA - As a baseline I would add reCAPTCHA v3 as this is alot less intrusive for the user experience so you won't be blocked by the pop-up clicking the images asked for and will be checked based on a score system provided by google. once I have registered reCAPTCHA on google i would then use the coded provided to let the form and reCAPTCHA talk to each other.

Regex - This would be finding the regex values and implementing the neccessary ones needed for the form.
